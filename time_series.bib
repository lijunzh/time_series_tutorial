  abstract	= { The growing use of computers for mechanized inventory
		  control and production planning has brought with it the
		  need for explicit forecasts of sales and usage for
		  individual products and materials. These forecasts must be
		  made on a routine basis for thousands of products, so that
		  they must be made quickly, and, both in terms of computing
		  time and information storage, cheaply; they should be
		  responsive to changing conditions. The paper presents a
		  method of forecasting sales which has these desirable
		  characteristics, and which in terms of ability to forecast
		  compares favorably with other, more traditional methods.
		  Several models of the exponential forecasting system are
		  presented, along with several examples of application. }
